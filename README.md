# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/123) goal.

## Specifications

List of specifications (specs) for the completed goal. These are declarative sentences (statements) describing a feature of the final product.

This is a core goal. The specifications are non-negotiable. To complete this goal, you must complete all specs listed below.

- [X] Can run all tests with npm test.
- [ ] All tests are passing.
- [X] For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
- [ ] a test file with at least 2 unit tests using valid inputs, and at least 1 unit test using invalid inputs.
- [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm.

## Required

Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals.

  - [x] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.

## Quality Rubric
### Well formatted code

   - Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. npm run lint). [50 points]
   - Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]


## Clear and useful README

   - Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]
   - Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]

### Good project management

   - Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]
   - All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]
   - Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]
   - Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person. [25 points]


## Installation and Setup
  - [X] Must include in the package.json file: author, git repo, expect, the right version of npm, and MIT license.
  - [X] Install all dependencies in the terminal by entering the command "npm i". [50 points]
  - [X] Create two separate files for every given function: one for testing and the other to store code.
